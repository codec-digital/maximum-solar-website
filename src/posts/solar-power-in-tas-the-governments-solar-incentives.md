### _Discover how the Tasmanian government champion renewable energy with incentive based programs, and rewards._ 

*State government has incentives to reduce the upfront costs on your solar panel system.*

Hey Tasmanians! Ever looked up at the sky and thought, "Wow, that's a lot of sunshine going to waste"?  Well, you are not alone. In Hobart solar is growing and shining as bright as ever. 

Solar power is the talk of the town, and for good reasons. It is like the universe is throwing free energy our  way, and it is about time we caught it. Let us look at solar panels, the benefits they bring, and how the  Tasmanian government is making it a sweet deal for us all to explore the realm of installing solar panels. 



#### Solar Power: The Bright Choice for Energy Bill Relief. 



*   **Clean and Green -** First up, solar energy is as clean as it gets. It is like nature's own energy drink,  minus the sugar rush and with all the benefits. No pollutants, no nasty emissions – just pure, clean  energy. It is our ticket to keeping Tassie as pristine as we love it. 

*   **Wallet-Friendly -** But here is the kicker: solar power is not simply good for the earth; it is great for  your wallet too. 

    Imagine slashing those electricity bills and having more dough for the things you love. Once you  are set up, the energy from the sun is practically free.  

    And with the option to sell excess power back to the grid, you could even turn a profit. Cheers to  that amazing financial incentive!

*   **Independence Day, Every Day -** With solar panels, you are the captain of your own ship. By  using less grid power, you protect yourself from price increases and energy shortages. It is like  building your own personal fortress, but with energy. 

*   **Tougher Than a Tassie Devil -** And don't worry about upkeep. Solar panels are tough. They  come with long warranties and ask for little more than the occasional clean. It is the set-and-forget  solution to energy independence. 




#### The Sunny Side of Energy in Tasmania explained.



The Tassie government is on board with solar, and they're not shy about it. They've rolled out some  fantastic incentives to make hobart solar more accessible and appealing to everyone. 

• **Feed-in Tariffs: Your Energy, Your Income -** The Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme is brilliant. It is like  the grid is buying you a beer for every bit of power your panels produce but do not use. You get to  watch your meters spin backward and your bank account grow. Now, that is a rewarding feeling! 

• **Solar Rebates: Making the Jump Easier -** Jumping into solar can feel like a big leap, but with the  Solar Rebate program, it is more of a gentle hop.  

Whether you are decking out your home, your business, or your community centre, these rebates  help take the edge off the upfront costs. 

• **Battery Storage: Power on Tap -** Battery storage allows you to store solar energy for later use.  The Battery Rebate scheme is like a savings account for electricity. 

• **Interest-Free Loans: The Sweetener -** The Tasmanian Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme (TEELS)  is like the cherry on top. Interest-free loans mean you can greenify your energy setup without the  financial sting. Making sustainable living easy.
