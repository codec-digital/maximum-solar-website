At the heart of Australia's renewable energy revolution, is a partnership between Maximum Solar and [Tindo Solar.](https://tindosolar.com.au/) As the demand for sustainable energy solutions continues to grow, this collaboration brings high-quality, Australian-made solar panels to homes across the nation but especially here in Tasmania.


## **Why Choose Australian-Made Solar Panels?**

When it comes to solar panels, going local has its perks. Tindo Solar, Australia's only manufacturer of solar panels, has been producing high quality panels in Adelaide since 2011. 

*   By choosing Australian-made panels, you're not just investing in quality; you're supporting local jobs and contributing to the growth of our domestic renewable energy sector.


*   Tindo panels are designed specifically for Australia's harsh climate, ensuring optimal performance in our unique conditions.


With a global success rate 200 times higher than average, Tindo panels offer unparalleled reliability. This means you can trust that your investment will stand the test of time, providing clean energy for years to come.

## **How Do Tindo Solar Panels Compare to Imported Options?**

When it comes to efficiency and durability, Tindo Solar panels are leading the pack. With an impressive efficiency rating of 20.4%, these panels convert a higher proportion of sunlight into usable energy compared to many alternatives on the market.

This translates to more power generation from fewer panels, maximising your roof space and energy output. Not only that, but Tindo panels are built to withstand Australia's extreme weather conditions, from scorching summers to unpredictable storms. 

This resilience means less maintenance and replacement costs over time, making them a smart investment for your [home](https://www.maximumsolar.com.au/residential-solar) especially in a place like Hobart.

## **What Makes Maximum Solar and Tindo Solar a Winning Combination?**

Maximum Solar's partnership with Tindo Solar brings together two companies committed to excellence in the Australian solar industry. 

*   As a trusted installer, Maximum Solar ensures that Tindo's high-quality panels are expertly fitted to your home, maximising their performance and longevity.


*   This collaboration also means you'll have access to comprehensive support and service.


*    With both companies based in Australia, you can expect responsive customer service and quick resolution of any issues that may arise. 


This local presence is a significant advantage over imported options, where after-sales support can often be a challenge.

## **How Does This Partnership Benefit the Australian Economy?**

By choosing Maximum Solar and Tindo panels, you're directly supporting Australian jobs and manufacturing. 

*   Tindo Solar's expansion and partnerships with local suppliers like Capral Aluminium are creating new opportunities in the renewable energy sector.

 This investment in local manufacturing capabilities ensures that more of the economic benefits of Australia's transition to renewable energy stay within our borders.

## **What Does the Future Hold for Australian Solar Manufacturing?**

The future looks bright for Australian solar manufacturing, with Tindo Solar at the forefront. Plans for the new Gigafactory could increase Tindo's production capacity to 1GW per year, a significant boost from their current 150MW annual output. 

*   This expansion will help meet the growing demand for solar panels in Australia, where rooftop solar capacity is projected to rise from 20GW today to between 66GW and 100GW over the next three decades.


*   As the industry grows, we can expect to see continued innovation in solar technology.
